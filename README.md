# Flight trip planner (Europe)
Author: Michael Kimmer

## Overview
This project is a flight trip planner with custom parameters settings.

The reason for creation is that conventional flight searching pages cannot be adjusted to the precise extent. Moreover many of them don't offer the cheapest flights that can be found directly at airlines' pages.


## Wanted functionalities
- Find the cheapest flights
- Plan a trip with two or more stops
- Plan a trip where each stop can contain more (nearby) airports
- Each stop can be constrained in time
- Include transfers

## Included airlines
- Ryanair
    - the data can be obtained by HTTP GET method
- Wizz Air 
    - (in future)
